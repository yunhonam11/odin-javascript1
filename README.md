Library 

This application is for keeping track of lists of books that the user has read and not read (but might be interested in reading).
It uses localStorage so that refreshing the page does not wipe the data. Although it meets the full specification of the project requirements,
there's much left to be done. It is able to add new books, delete existing books, and move the books between the two lists.
This application was used to learn CSS animations and linear gradient. 

TODO: Google cloud storage option, array sort options, edit option

This is my take on the first project assignment found on the Odin Project's Javascript course. 
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library 
This application is made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
